<h2>
    Top Rivers to Fish
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>1. Clackamas River</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Closest major steelhead fishery (&lt;30 min from downtown Portland). Known for huge winter hatchery returns (often exceeding 2,000 fish yearly) and solid summer runs. Key bank access spots include Carver Park, High Rocks, Eagle Creek mouth, and Riverside Park.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>2. Sandy River</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Flows past Gresham and Troutdale. Winter runs peak in January–February; summer steelhead arrive in May–July. Best access at <strong>Oxbow</strong>, <strong>Lewis &amp; Clark Park</strong>, <strong>Dodge Park</strong>, Cedar Creek (hatchery), and Revenue Bridge.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>3. Willamette River (Below Willamette Falls)</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Winter steelhead congregate at <strong>Meldrum Bar</strong> in Gladstone. Anglers regularly plunk Spin-N-Glos from shore. It’s a prime urban fishery upstream of the Clackamas mouth.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>4. Columbia River (Lower Section Near Portland)</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Summer steelhead join spring Chinook runs in mid to late summer. Bank access near Sauvie Island beaches, Reeder Road, and Government Island offer plunking and trolling opportunities.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>5. Wilson River &amp; Coastal Creeks</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    About 1.5 hours west toward the coast, the Wilson, Trask, Nehalem, and Kilchis rivers support significant winter runs—especially wild fish—often manageable from public banks along Highway 6.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>6. Tributaries like Eagle Creek</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    A smaller stream feeding the Clackamas. Offers early winter hatchery steelhead fishing when Clackamas is high and muddy. Access at <strong>Bonnie Lure Park</strong>, near the hatchery, and along Rainbow Road.&nbsp;

    Gear &amp; Tactics for Steelhead
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Gear:</strong> Medium-heavy spinning rods (9–10 ft) or 7–8 wt fly rods. Use 12–20 lb braid with fluoro leaders or sink-tip lines if fly fishing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Techniques:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Drift fish with roe, yarnies, or cured eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plunk plugs like Spin‑N‑Glos or Kwikfish near eddies and current seams.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use spinners and spoons from boats in deeper flows.
            </li>
            <li>
                For fly gear, swing egg or leech patterns near tailouts.
            </li>
        </ul>
