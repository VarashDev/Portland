<h2>
    Introduction to Steelhead Fishing Near Portland
</h2>
<p>
    Nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest, Portland, Oregon offers anglers a unique advantage—easy access to some of the most productive steelhead rivers in the United States. Steelhead, a sea-run form of rainbow trout, migrate between freshwater and the Pacific Ocean, offering both summer and winter fishing opportunities. Whether you're a seasoned fly angler or a weekend bank fisher, Portland puts you just a short drive from world-class steelhead waters.
</p>
<p>
    There are two main types of steelhead runs in Oregon:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer-run steelhead</strong> begin arriving in rivers as early as May and continue through October.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter-run steelhead</strong> are more robust and appear between November and April.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Fishing methods vary from casting spoons and spinners to drifting bait or swinging flies. With abundant access to both urban and remote waters, Portland is a prime steelhead fishing hub.
</p>
<h2>
    Columbia River – The Iconic Giant
</h2>
<p>
    The Columbia River is the backbone of the Pacific Northwest's fisheries and an essential destination for steelhead anglers. This vast river forms much of Oregon’s northern boundary and flows directly through Portland, making it highly accessible.
</p>
<h3>
    Why It's Great for Steelhead:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Hosts both summer and winter steelhead runs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Excellent fish counts, particularly near Bonneville Dam.
    </li>
    <li>
        Opportunities for both bank and boat fishing.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Best Access Points:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Bonneville Dam area</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Rooster Rock State Park</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Government Island boat ramps</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Best Times to Fish:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Summer run: July to September
    </li>
    <li>
        Winter run: January to March
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Due to the river’s size, it’s best to check real-time dam counts and fish movement patterns from the Oregon Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (ODFW) before planning your trip.
</p>
<h2>
    Clackamas River – Urban Access Meets Quality Fishing
</h2>
<p>
    Only 20 minutes southeast of downtown Portland, the Clackamas River is a steelhead angler’s dream with consistent hatchery and wild runs.
</p>
<h3>
    Where to Fish:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Riverside Park</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>McIver State Park</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Barton Bridge</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Tips for Success:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use roe or soft beads for winter steelhead.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drift fishing works well in the deep tailouts.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Clackamas supports a strong hatchery program, meaning harvest opportunities are good during peak months, particularly December through March.
</p>
<h2>
    Sandy River – A Local Favorite
</h2>
<p>
    The Sandy River, flowing directly into the Columbia near Troutdale, is a favorite among Portland locals. Fed by glaciers from Mt. Hood, its cold, clear waters are perfect for steelhead.
</p>
<h3>
    Hotspots:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Dabney State Park</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Oxbow Regional Park</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cedar Creek</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Steelhead Runs:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter run:</strong> Peak in January and February
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer run:</strong> Arrive in late May
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The Sandy can blow out during heavy rain. Check flow conditions before heading out.
</p>
<h2>
    Willamette River – Hidden Opportunities
</h2>
<p>
    While not known primarily for steelhead, the Willamette River and its tributaries offer decent seasonal opportunities, particularly around confluences with larger rivers.
</p>
<h3>
    Best Tributaries:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Tryon Creek</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Johnson Creek</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tualatin River (lower sections)</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Willamette is best explored by kayak or small boat, and while catches are less frequent, the peaceful settings and low pressure are ideal for patient anglers.
</p>
<h2>
    Kalama River (WA) – Worth the Short Drive
</h2>
<p>
    Just 45 minutes from Portland across the Columbia River, the Kalama is a steelhead hotspot known for its aggressive summer-run fish.
</p>
<h3>
    Fishing Tips:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Try the canyon section for wading access.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use jigs under bobbers during low water periods.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Regulation Note:</strong> A Washington license is required.
</p>
<h2>
    Lewis River (WA) – Scenic and Productive
</h2>
<p>
    The Lewis River is another nearby Washington river offering excellent fishing with fewer crowds.
</p>
<h3>
    Fishing Advice:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The lower Lewis is productive from late winter into spring.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use drifting techniques with yarn balls or cured eggs.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Boat launches are available, but there are also ample bank fishing areas, especially near the hatchery.
</p>
<h2>
    Eagle Creek – Small Stream with Big Surprises
</h2>
<p>
    A hidden gem, Eagle Creek offers small water steelhead fishing just off the Columbia Gorge.
</p>
<h3>
    Why It’s Special:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ideal for light tackle or fly fishing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Solitude and scenic beauty.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It fishes best during December and January when winter steelhead move upstream.
</p>
<h2>
    North Fork Nehalem River – Coastal But Close
</h2>
<p>
    About 90 minutes west of Portland, this river punches above its weight in steelhead productivity.
</p>
<h3>
    What to Expect:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Excellent bank access.
    </li>
    <li>
        Hatchery winter steelhead from late November to February.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Don’t forget rain gear—this is coastal Oregon after all!
</p>
<h2>
    Washougal River (WA) – A Lesser-Known Treasure
</h2>
<p>
    The Washougal River is often overshadowed by its neighbors, but it holds strong runs of both summer and winter steelhead.
</p>
<h3>
    Hot Spots:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Access near the bridge in Washougal.
    </li>
    <li>
        Canyon sections above the hatchery.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This river fishes well even after light rain, making it a good choice during stormy weeks.
</p>
<h2>
   Fishing Regulations in Oregon &amp; Washington
</h2>
<p>
    Before you go, be sure to check both Oregon and Washington fishing regulations, especially since you may be fishing in both states.
</p>
<h3>
    Things You’ll Need:
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Oregon/Washington angling license</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Harvest tags for steelhead</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Barbless hooks</strong> in some areas
    </li>

    Tips from Local Anglers
</h2>
<p>
    Some insights from Oregon-based steelhead veterans:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>“Fish the first and last hours of daylight.”</strong> Steelhead are more active during low light.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“Move around. Don’t stay in one hole all day.”</strong> Covering water increases your odds.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“Pack multiple setups.”</strong> Conditions can shift rapidly; having bait, lures, and flies gives you options.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“Watch water clarity.”</strong> Ideal clarity is 2–4 feet for most rivers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“Talk to others.”</strong> Friendly anglers are often willing to share tips and successful methods.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    By learning from those who fish these rivers regularly, you'll increase your odds of landing that prized steelhead.
