<h2>
    Introduction to Pink Salmon Fishing in the Pacific Northwest
</h2>
<p>
    Pink salmon, also known as humpies, are among the most sought-after fish during their biennial runs along the Pacific Northwest. Their abundance, aggressive bite, and manageable size make them a perfect target for both beginner and experienced anglers. Although they primarily spawn in odd-numbered years, their return to rivers near Portland, Oregon in 2025 promises to be an exciting season for salmon fishing enthusiasts.
</p>
<p>
    These salmon are typically found in coastal and inland waterways during their spawning migration. Their journey from the ocean to freshwater rivers brings them through key areas around Portland, offering anglers the chance to reel in a prize without traveling too far from the city.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s dive deeper into how and where you can successfully catch pink salmon this year near Portland, Oregon.
</p>
<h2>
    The Pink Salmon Run: When It Happens and Why It Matters
</h2>
<h3>
   Biennial Run Cycles Explained
</h3>
<p>
    Pink salmon runs occur every two years—specifically in <strong>odd-numbered years</strong> like 2025. These runs are largely predictable, making them a favorite among seasonal anglers. The migration typically begins in <strong>late July</strong> and continues into <strong>September</strong>, with the peak occurring in <strong>mid to late August</strong>.
</p>
<h3>
    Forecast for the 2025 Season
</h3>
<p>
    Biologists are predicting a <strong>strong pink salmon return</strong> in 2025 due to favorable ocean conditions in the prior years. Anglers can expect thousands of fish to make their way into tributaries of the Columbia River and other local waterways around Portland.
</p>
<h2>
    Legal Regulations for Salmon Fishing in Oregon

<h3>

    Tips from Local Anglers
</h2>
<p>
    Local knowledge is often the best kind of knowledge, especially when it comes to catching pink salmon. Anglers who frequent rivers near Portland have a few time-tested tips:
</p>
<h3>
    Proven Strategies
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Retrieve speed matters</strong>: Use a slow, steady retrieve when using spinners or spoons.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>

<h3>
    Common Mistakes to Avoid
</h3>

        Fishing <strong>too deep</strong>: Pinks often travel in the top 5–10 feet of water.

    </li>
    <li>
        Not adjusting for <strong>crowds</strong>: Popular rivers get packed—arrive early or fish weekday mornings.
    </li>
</ul>
