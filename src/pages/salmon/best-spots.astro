<h3>
    <strong>1. Willamette River (Portland to Oregon City)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        A rare urban river offering <strong>spring Chinook</strong> runs in April–May, and <strong>fall Coho</strong> in September–October.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bank anglers often fish at <strong>Meldrum Bar</strong>, <strong>Clackamette Park</strong>, and <strong>Sellwood Riverfront Park</strong>, while boat anglers troll herring or spinners in deeper river sections.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>2. Clackamas River</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Just 20–30 minutes southeast of Portland. Excellent for both <strong>spring Chinook</strong> and <strong>fall Coho</strong>, with strong <strong>steelhead</strong>runs too.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fishing access at <strong>Carver Park</strong>, <strong>Riverside Park</strong>, <strong>High Rocks</strong>, and <strong>Milo McIver State Park</strong>. Drift fishing with roe or jigs is highly effective.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>3. Sandy River</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Around 20 minutes east of Portland, offers consistent spring and fall Chinook, along with <strong>Coho</strong> and <strong>steelhead</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prime access points include <strong>Dodge Park</strong>, <strong>Lewis &amp; Clark State Park</strong>, <strong>Oxbow Regional Park</strong>, and near the hatchery at Cedar Creek.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>4. Multnomah Channel (Sauvie Island area)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        A quieter tributary of the Willamette River, productive for <strong>spring Chinook</strong> and fall runs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Popular banks include <strong>Scappoose Bay</strong> and areas near the Gilbert River. Techniques like back-bouncing bait or trolling near structure are effective.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>5. Tillamook Bay &amp; Nehalem River (Coastal Options)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        About 1.5 hours from Portland, offering some of the best trophy <strong>fall Chinook and Coho</strong> fishing within reach.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use plug-cut herring or trolling techniques in tidal zones and river mouths.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>6. Wilson &amp; Trask Rivers (Tillamook Coast)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scenic rivers offering <strong>fall Chinook</strong> and <strong>winter steelhead</strong> in a more remote setting (~1.5 hours away).
    </li>
</ul>

    Techniques &amp; Gear Recommendations
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Trolling</strong>: Use flashers, herring, or Anchovies in Columbia, Willamette, and Multnomah Channel.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Drift Fishing</strong>: Especially productive on Clackamas and Sandy Rivers using roe clusters or jigs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Bank Fishing</strong>: Effective at Clackamette, Meldrum Bar, and Sandy “Dodge Park”, especially for hatchery Chinook and Coho.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Rules &amp; Regulations
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>License &amp; Combined Angling Tag</strong> are required for Chinook, Coho, steelhead, and other inland species.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Columbia River Endorsement</strong> is also required when fishing in Columbia tributaries or estuary zones.
    </li>
    <li>
        Be mindful of <strong>size limits, daily bag limits</strong>, and closures—especially for wild salmon stocks.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Local Tips &amp; Observations
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        “The springer run is happening on the Willamette … You can fish the Clackamas from Riverside Park, Carver Park, Barton Park… The Sandy at Lewis &amp; Clark, Dabney, Oxbow, Dodge Park…”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Sandy is indeed a good spot … hatchery coho season for Clackamas and Sandy runs Sept‑Oct.”
    </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Sandy and Clackamas Rivers</strong> remain top public bank fisheries—especially during high coho runs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Multnomah Channel</strong> often has better bite and less crowding than the main river.
    </li>
    <li>
        For those with boats, <strong>Columbia River fishing</strong> at Kelly Point and Sauvie Island is excellent in summer and fall.
    </li>
</ul>
