<h2>
    Introduction to Coho Salmon Fishing in the Pacific Northwest
</h2>
<p>
    Coho salmon, also known as silver salmon, are one of the most exciting sportfish in the Pacific Northwest. Known for their aggressive strikes and acrobatic fights, Coho are a favorite among both novice and seasoned anglers. In Oregon, especially near Portland, these fish return in droves during their spawning runs, offering fantastic opportunities for shore and boat fishing.
</p>
<p>
    Coho typically weigh between 6 and 12 pounds, although fish in the 15- to 20-pound range are not uncommon in Oregon’s robust rivers. Their vibrant silver bodies and distinct hooked jaws (kype) make them easy to identify, and their strong upstream battle makes each catch memorable.
</p>
<h2>
    Why Portland, Oregon is a Prime Spot for Coho Fishing
</h2>
<p>
    Portland sits at the intersection of some of the most productive Coho salmon rivers in the state. With easy access to the Columbia River, Clackamas, Sandy, and Willamette Rivers, Portland offers anglers both urban convenience and wild natural beauty. This unique position allows you to be on prime fishing water in under an hour from most parts of the city.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, Oregon’s commitment to fishery management has helped maintain healthy Coho populations. Hatchery programs and seasonal regulations ensure consistent returns and ample chances for anglers to catch their limit during the open seasons.
</p>
<h2>
    Best Time of Year to Catch Coho Salmon Near Portland
</h2>
<p>
    Timing is everything when it comes to salmon fishing. Coho typically begin their run in <strong>late August</strong> and peak through <strong>October</strong>, with some fish still trickling in by early November depending on river conditions and rainfall.
</p>

    Here's a quick month-by-month breakdown:

    Top Rivers and Tributaries for Coho Salmon Fishing
</h2>
<h3>
    Columbia River System
</h3>
<p>
    The Columbia River is the highway for Coho salmon entering Oregon from the Pacific. Bank and boat anglers can target Coho in the mainstem, particularly near <strong>Bonneville Dam</strong>, <strong>Multnomah Channel</strong>, and the <strong>mouth of the Sandy River</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Boat trolling with spinners and hoochies behind flashers is common here. Pay attention to zone-specific regulations as sections of the Columbia open and close at different times.
</p>
<h3>
    Sandy River
</h3>
<p>
    Just 20 miles east of Portland, the Sandy River is a Coho hotspot. Popular access points include <strong>Dabney State Recreation Area</strong>, <strong>Oxbow Park</strong>, and <strong>Cedar Creek</strong>. Anglers often drift eggs or cast spinners, and many fish are caught from shore.
</p>
<p>
    The Sandy runs strong with hatchery Coho, making it ideal for harvest-minded anglers. September and early October are best.
</p>
<h3>
    Clackamas River
</h3>
<p>
    Running through Gladstone and Oregon City, the Clackamas River hosts both hatchery and wild Coho. Bank access is plentiful along <strong>Highway 224</strong>, and boat launches can be found at <strong>Carver</strong> and <strong>Riverside Park</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The river's deep pools and riffles make it perfect for both fly and spin fishing. September through October is the ideal time here.
</p>
<h3>
    Willamette River
</h3>
<p>
    While not as famous as the Sandy or Clackamas for Coho, the Willamette offers action, especially near its confluence with the Columbia. Urban anglers fish from docks and jetties in <strong>Portland Harbor</strong>, often using spinners and eggs.
</p>
<p>
    This section is best in <strong>late August through September</strong>, when fresh Coho are moving in.
</p>

<h2>
    Fishing Techniques That Work Best for Coho Salmon
</h2>
<h3>
    Bank Fishing Methods
</h3>
<p>
    Coho salmon are aggressive and can be successfully targeted from the riverbank. Here are popular techniques that work near Portland:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Casting Spinners:</strong> Bright-colored spinners like Blue Fox or Mepps (#3 or #4) in pink, orange, or chartreuse are deadly. Cast across the current and retrieve at a moderate pace.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Drift Fishing with Eggs:</strong> Cured salmon eggs suspended with a small corkie or float are a proven Coho catcher. Use light lead and drift through deep pools.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Float Fishing:</strong> Suspending bait or a jig below a float allows you to present your offering at just the right depth. Ideal for slower water like the Sandy or Clackamas.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Make sure to keep your setup light but strong. A 9-10 ft medium-action rod with 10–12 lb test line works well for most bank scenarios.
</p>
<h3>
    Boat Fishing Tactics
</h3>
<p>
    If you have access to a boat, trolling opens up more water and tactics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Trolling with Flashers and Hoochies:</strong> A flasher combined with a pink or chartreuse hoochie and herring strip is a go-to rig. Troll slowly, especially early in the morning.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Wobbling Plugs:</strong> Kwikfish or MagLips can provoke aggressive strikes, especially when back-trolled through holding water.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tidewater Trolling:</strong> Near the mouths of rivers like the Sandy and Clackamas, tidewater trolling is effective in late summer when Coho are staging.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Boaters should always check local boating regulations and be aware of water levels and flows.
</p>
<h3>
    Fly Fishing for Coho
</h3>
<p>
    Fly anglers are increasingly targeting Coho in Oregon rivers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Flies:</strong> Try pink, purple, or chartreuse patterns like Egg-sucking Leeches, Clouser Minnows, or Comets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Presentation:</strong> Strip the fly with short, erratic movements in 2–6 feet of water.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gear:</strong> A 7- to 8-weight rod with a sink-tip line works best in fast-moving water.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Fly fishing works best when fish are stacked in riffles or when water clarity is good.
</p>
