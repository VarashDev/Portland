<h2>
    Understanding Chum Salmon
</h2>
<h3>
    What Are Chum Salmon?
</h3>
<p>
    Chum salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus keta</i>), also known as dog salmon due to the male's prominent canine-like teeth during spawning, are one of the five Pacific salmon species. They are known for their vibrant coloration during spawning season—males often display bold vertical stripes in shades of purple, green, and red.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike Chinook or Coho salmon, chum are not commonly targeted for their table quality. However, they provide an exhilarating fight on the line and play an essential ecological role in Oregon’s river systems.

<h2>
    Chum Salmon Migration in Oregon
</h2>
<h3>
    When Do Chum Salmon Run Near Portland?
</h3>
<p>
    Chum salmon typically migrate from the Pacific Ocean into Oregon’s freshwater streams from <strong>late October through December</strong>. This late fall run provides a narrow but productive window for anglers. Water temperatures and river flow are crucial factors influencing their migration.
</p>
<h3>
    Life Cycle and Behavior
</h3>
<p>
    Chum salmon return to the exact stream in which they were born to spawn, completing a journey that often exceeds 1,000 miles. After spawning, chum salmon die, enriching the ecosystem with vital nutrients. Understanding this cycle helps anglers plan the best times to fish and appreciate the biological significance of their catch.
</p>
<h2>
   Prime Fishing Locations Around Portland
</h2>
<h3>
    Best Rivers and Streams
</h3>
<p>
    Portland’s proximity to major rivers makes it an ideal base for chum fishing. Some of the top spots include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Sandy River</strong> – Close to town, with decent bank access and occasional chum sightings.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Willamette River Tributaries</strong> – Certain tributaries (like the Tualatin) see light runs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Columbia River East Fork Lewis</strong> (just across the border in Washington) – Offers more consistent chum action.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Top Local Hotspots and Access Points
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Oxbow Regional Park (Sandy River)</strong> – Well-managed area with clear bank fishing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Lewis River Hatchery Area (WA)</strong> – A regional favorite, just 45 minutes from Portland.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scappoose Bay</strong> – A tidal slough that connects with the Columbia River, sometimes productive in late fall.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Best Time to Fish for Chum Salmon
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Peak Months</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The <strong>peak season</strong> for chum salmon fishing near Portland is <strong>mid-November to early December</strong>. This window coincides with increased river flows from fall rains, which signal the salmon to begin their spawning run.
</p>
<h3>
    Weather and Water Conditions
</h3>
<p>
    Chum prefer <strong>cooler water temperatures (45°F to 55°F)</strong> and moderate river flows. Avoid fishing immediately after heavy rains when water is too murky or fast-moving. Ideal conditions include <strong>slightly rising river levels</strong> and <strong>good water clarity</strong>.
</p>
<h2>
    Oregon Fishing Regulations for Chum Salmon
</h2>
<h3>
    Licensing and Permits
</h3>
<p>
    To fish for salmon in Oregon, you'll need:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Oregon Angling License</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Combined Angling Tag</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Columbia River Basin Endorsement</strong> (for certain tributaries)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Be aware that <strong>Washington State licenses are required</strong> if fishing on the north side of the Columbia or in WA rivers like the Lewis or Kalama.
</p>
<h3>
    Catch Limits and Restrictions
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Retention of chum salmon is often prohibited in Oregon.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        In Washington, some rivers <strong>allow limited retention</strong>—check WDFW guidelines.

        <strong>Always consult current regulations</strong> on river-specific allowances before heading out.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Fishing Techniques That Work
</h2>
<h3>
    Fly Fishing vs Spin Fishing
</h3>
<p>
    Both methods are effective, but your choice may depend on water conditions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Fly Fishing</strong> – Effective in shallow runs. Use bright streamer flies resembling salmon eggs or shrimp.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Spin Fishing</strong> – Good for deeper pools. Use jigs, spinners, or drift rigs with yarn balls.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Effective Casting Strategies
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Drift Fishing</strong> – Cast upstream and allow your lure to drift naturally.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Float Fishing</strong> – Ideal in slow-moving water. Keeps bait in the strike zone longer.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sight Fishing</strong> – Look for chum near gravel bars or tailouts where they gather to spawn.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Recommended Gear and Tackle
</h2>
<h3>
    Rods, Reels, and Line
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Rod:</strong> Medium to heavy-action 9-10 ft rod
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Reel:</strong> Spinning or baitcasting reel with strong drag
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Line:</strong> 20-30 lb braided mainline with 15-20 lb fluorocarbon leader
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Best Bait and Lures for Chum
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Jigs with pink/purple skirts</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cured salmon roe</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Yarn balls soaked in shrimp oil</strong>

    Best Practices for Catch and Release
</h2>
<h3>
    Handling Techniques
</h3>
<p>
    If you're practicing catch and release (especially in Oregon, where chum retention is often prohibited), proper handling is critical to the fish's survival:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Keep the fish in the water</strong> as much as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use <strong>rubber or knotless landing nets</strong> to minimize injury.
    </li>
    <li>
        Handle fish <strong>gently with wet hands</strong>—never squeeze or hold by the gills.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Remove hooks quickly</strong> and carefully; use pliers or a dehooker if needed.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Gear That Minimizes Harm
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Barbless hooks</strong>: Easier to remove and cause less damage.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Circle hooks</strong>: Reduce deep hooking.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Single-hook setups</strong>: Better than trebles for safe releases.
    </li>
</ul>
