<h2>
    Introduction to Cutthroat Trout Fishing in the Pacific Northwest
</h2>
<h3>
    What Makes Cutthroat Trout Unique
</h3>
<p>
    Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) are a beloved native species known for their distinctive reddish-orange slashes beneath the jaw. These beautiful fish thrive in Oregon's clean, cold waterways and offer a spirited fight on light tackle.
</p>
<h3>
   Popularity in Oregon Waters
</h3>
<p>
    Among Oregon’s numerous trout species, the Cutthroat stands out due to its adaptability. Found in both freshwater and coastal environments, it’s especially prevalent in rivers around Portland. Anglers appreciate their accessibility and the challenge they present — making Cutthroat Trout fishing a cherished local pastime.
</p>
<h2>
    Understanding the Cutthroat Trout Species
</h2>
<h3>
    Native vs. Coastal Cutthroat
</h3>
<p>
    Oregon is home to several subspecies, but the <strong>Coastal Cutthroat Trout</strong> is the most common near Portland. These fish may exhibit <strong>anadromous behavior</strong> (migrating between salt and freshwater) or reside year-round in rivers and streams.
</p>
<h3>
   Life Cycle and Habits
</h3>
<p>
    Cutthroat spawn in spring and early summer. They prefer gravel-bottomed streams with good cover and oxygenation. Understanding their behavior helps anglers predict their location — especially during spawning runs and cooler weather.
</p>
<h2>
    Best Seasons for Cutthroat Trout Fishing near Portland
</h2>
<h3>
    Spring &amp; Summer Conditions
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Late spring and early summer</strong> are peak times. Warmer temperatures increase insect hatches, drawing trout to feed aggressively on the surface. Fly fishing is particularly effective during this period.
</p>
<h3>
    Fall Fishing Opportunities
</h3>
<p>
    Fall brings cooler waters and fewer anglers. As leaves change and the rivers calm, Cutthroat become active again, preparing for winter by feeding heavily — ideal for those seeking solitude and steady action.
</p>
<h2>
    Top Locations for Cutthroat Trout Fishing near Portland
</h2>
<h3>
    Clackamas River
</h3>
<p>
    A tributary of the Willamette, the Clackamas is renowned for both resident and sea-run Cutthroat. Wade-in spots and drift access are plentiful near Estacada and Milo McIver State Park.
</p>
<h3>
    Sandy River
</h3>
<p>
    Just east of Portland, the Sandy River offers excellent fly and spin fishing. Its glacier-fed waters are home to robust Cutthroat populations, especially near Dodge Park and Oxbow Regional Park.
</p>
<h3>
    Tryon Creek and Johnson Creek
</h3>
<p>
    Often overlooked, these urban creeks support surprising numbers of Cutthroat. Accessible by trail systems, they provide peaceful escapes without leaving the city.
</p>
<h3>
   Columbia River Tributaries
</h3>
<p>
    Small feeders like Tanner Creek and Eagle Creek offer seasonal opportunities, particularly when water levels are moderate. Look for riffles and shaded pools during the summer months.
</p>
<h2>
    Rules and Regulations You Must Know
</h2>
<h3>
    Oregon Fishing License Requirements
</h3>
<p>
    A valid Oregon fishing license is mandatory. You may also need a Combined Angling Tag if targeting sea-run Cutthroat. These are available online via the ODFW website.
</p>
<h3>
    Catch Limits &amp; Seasonal Restrictions
</h3>
<p>
    Most areas near Portland enforce a <strong>2 trout per day</strong> limit for streams, with some catch-and-release only zones. Check local signage and the annual fishing regulations booklet before casting.
</p>
<h2>
    Best Bait and Lures for Cutthroat Trout
</h2>
<h3>
    Fly Fishing Flies
</h3>
<p>
    Dry flies like Elk Hair Caddis and Adams work well during hatch seasons. Nymphs and streamers (e.g., Woolly Buggers) are effective year-round.
</p>
<h3>
    Spinners and Soft Plastics
</h3>
<p>
    Small inline spinners (like Panther Martins) and single-hook soft plastics on ultralight setups are productive, especially in murky water.
</p>
<h3>
    Natural Bait Options
</h3>
<p>
    Worms and salmon eggs attract Cutthroat in deeper pools. Always check bait restrictions, as some urban creeks require artificial lures only.
</p>
