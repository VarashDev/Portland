<MyH2 text="Introduction to Trout Fishing in the Pacific Northwest" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Trout fishing near Portland, Oregon isn’t just a pastime—it’s a full-blown outdoor tradition rooted in the lush rivers, lakes, and scenic backdrops of the Pacific Northwest. With quick access to both urban fishing spots and wild mountain streams, Portland is a dream destination for beginner and seasoned anglers alike. Whether you're looking for stocked rainbow trout in a kid-friendly pond or wild cutthroat trout in a remote alpine stream, the region has something for everyone.
</p>
<MyH2 text="Why Portland Is a Prime Location for Trout Anglers" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Portland’s unique geographical location places it within arm’s reach of a wide array of trout fishing habitats—from glacier-fed rivers and mountain lakes to suburban ponds and park waters. Let’s explore what makes this city so special for trout fishing.
</p>
<MyH3 text="Unique Geography and Water Sources" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Nestled between the Cascade Mountains and the Willamette Valley, Portland is fed by an intricate system of rivers and lakes. The snowmelt and rainfall in this region ensure a continuous, cool flow of water that trout love—especially rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout. The Clackamas, Sandy, and Columbia rivers all play crucial roles in sustaining rich aquatic ecosystems.
</p>
<MyH3 text="Year-Round Fishing Opportunities" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Thanks to Oregon's relatively mild climate and proactive fish stocking programs, trout fishing is possible throughout the year. While summer is the most popular time to cast a line, seasoned locals know that winter and spring offer unique opportunities too—especially for those chasing trophy-sized trout in solitude.
</p>
<MyH2 text="Top 10 Trout Fishing Spots Near Portland, Oregon" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Now for the part you’ve been waiting for—where to fish. Here’s a curated list of the 10 best trout fishing spots within a 90-minute drive from Portland:

    Located about 25 miles southwest of Portland, Henry Hagg Lake is heavily stocked with rainbow trout and boasts excellent amenities like boat ramps, ADA-accessible docks, and picnic areas. The lake spans over 1,100 acres, giving anglers plenty of space to find their perfect spot.

    Just 40 minutes from the city, Estacada Lake offers two great spots in one. Both reservoirs are known for frequent ODFW trout stocking, calm waters, and accessibility, making them favorites for families and beginners.
</p>
<MyH3 text="4. Mount Hood Area Streams (Zigzag &amp; Salmon Rivers)" />
<p class="mb-4">

</p>
<MyH3 text="5. Clackamas River" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Running through the heart of Clackamas County, this river has several public access points and is stocked with hatchery rainbow trout. Fly fishers will appreciate the riffles and undercut banks ideal for nymph and dry fly techniques.
</p>

<MyH3 text="6. St. Louis Ponds" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Tucked away near Gervais, this chain of seven interconnected ponds is a haven for beginner anglers. Stocked frequently by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), St. Louis Ponds also feature ADA-accessible platforms, restrooms, and walking trails—making it ideal for family outings.
</p>
<MyH3 text="7. Blue Lake Regional Park" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Located in Fairview just east of Portland, Blue Lake offers an urban escape without the long drive. The lake is stocked seasonally with trout and has ample space for shoreline fishing. It also includes paddle boat rentals, playgrounds, and picnic areas.
</p>

</p>
<MyH3 text="9. Lake Harriet" />
<p class="mb-4">
    This peaceful reservoir along the Oak Grove Fork of the Clackamas River is a low-traffic location great for serious anglers. It's stocked with trout and offers excellent trolling or still-fishing opportunities by canoe or small boat.
</p>
<MyH3 text="10. Columbia Slough" />
<p class="mb-4">

</p>
<MyH2 text="Types of Trout Found Near Portland" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Oregon’s trout diversity adds flavor to your fishing adventures. Here are the key species you're likely to encounter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Rainbow Trout</strong> – The most commonly stocked and fished species
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cutthroat Trout</strong> – Native to the region, especially in streams and smaller rivers
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Brook Trout</strong> – Found in colder mountain waters and streams
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Brown Trout</strong> – Less common but available in specific locations like the Deschutes tributaries
    </li>
</ul>
<MyH3 text="Stocked vs. Wild Trout" />
<p class="mb-4">
    ODFW maintains a robust trout stocking program, especially in accessible lakes and ponds. These fish are hatchery-raised and usually easier to catch. Wild trout, on the other hand, tend to be more elusive and are typically found in remote areas. Wild trout often offer better fights and are vital to ecosystem health.
</p>
<MyH3 text="Native Species Conservation" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Many of Portland’s waters are home to native cutthroat and redband trout. Anglers are encouraged to practice catch-and-release in areas with wild trout populations and to learn how to identify these species to avoid unintentional harm.
</p>
<MyH2 text="Best Times and Seasons for Trout Fishing" />
<MyH3 text="Spring and Summer" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Late April through early July is peak season for trout fishing near Portland. Lakes are fully stocked, and trout are active and near the surface. Early mornings and late evenings provide the best chances during warmer months.
</p>
<MyH3 text="Fall and Winter Tactics" />
<p class="mb-4">
    Fall can be surprisingly productive, especially in rivers and streams where trout feed aggressively before winter. While winter fishing is slower, tailwaters and spring-fed areas can still yield results—especially for fly fishers using nymphs and streamers.
</p>
<MyH2 text="Permits, Licenses, and Fishing Regulations" />
<p class="mb-4">
    In Oregon, every angler 12 and older must have a valid fishing license. Here's a quick breakdown:
