<p class="mb-4">
    Fishing near Portland, Oregon, is more than a weekend hobby - it's a cherished pastime woven into the region's culture 
	and natural beauty. Whether you're a seasoned angler or just learning how to cast a line, the area's diverse rivers, 
	lakes, and streams offer exceptional fishing experiences all year long.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    Nestled between the Cascade Mountains and the Pacific Coast, Portland is the perfect launching point for both freshwater 
	and coastal fishing. Within just an hour's drive, you can access prime spots for <Link href="/salmon/", text="salmon" />, steelhead, trout, bass, and 
	even sturgeon. And with Oregon's commitment to conservation, many of these waters are managed to support healthy fish 
	populations and sustainable recreation.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
    This guide covers everything you need to know to enjoy fishing near Portland - from top spots and fish species to 
	regulations and expert tips. Let's dive in.
</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl text-teal-900 font-extrabold my-4">Types of Fishing You Can Enjoy Near Portland</h2>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">Freshwater Fishing</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Freshwater fishing is the most popular type in the Portland area. Rivers like the Willamette and Columbia are teeming 
	with salmon, trout, steelhead, and bass. These waterways offer both boat and bank fishing opportunities.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">Saltwater Fishing (Coastal Trips)</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Though Portland isn't on the coast, saltwater fishing trips to the Pacific Ocean are accessible via Astoria or Newport - 
	just a 2-hour drive. Here, you'll find halibut, lingcod, rockfish, and even tuna charters in summer.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">Fly Fishing</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Fly fishing enthusiasts flock to the Sandy and Clackamas Rivers. These fast-moving streams are ideal for targeting 
	trout and steelhead with dry flies and nymphs, especially during early spring and fall runs.
</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">Ice Fishing (Seasonal &amp; Rare)</h3>

    Ice fishing near Portland is rare but not impossible. Higher elevation lakes like Trillium occasionally freeze in

    <strong>Seasonal Fishing Guide (Month-by-Month)</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Spring: Steelhead, Trout, and Bass</strong>
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Spring is a prime time for steelhead fishing, particularly on the Sandy and Clackamas Rivers. Rainbow trout are stocked in various lakes, and bass begin moving to shallow waters. The moderate temperatures and increasing daylight make this season perfect for early morning and evening fishing sessions.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Summer: Salmon, Sturgeon, and Panfish</strong>
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Summer offers incredible diversity. Chinook and Coho salmon begin their upstream journey, while sturgeon become more active in the Columbia River. Warmwater lakes around Portland teem with panfish and bass, ideal for families and beginners.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Fall: Coho Salmon and Chinook</strong>
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Fall is when Coho and Chinook runs peak. You’ll see increased activity in tributaries like the Clackamas, Sandy, and Columbia. Fly fishing is particularly effective during this season, with salmon aggressively hitting streamer flies.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Winter: Steelhead and Trout</strong>
</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    Winter may seem off-season, but steelhead fishing thrives in the colder months, especially in the Clackamas and Sandy Rivers. Many lakes remain open for trout fishing, although access may be limited due to snow or ice in higher elevations.
</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl text-teal-900 font-bold my-4">
